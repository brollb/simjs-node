# SimJS-node

SimJS-node is a port of SimJS for use in NodeJS. 

## About SimJS

*SIM.JS is a general-purpose Discrete Event Simulation library written entirely in JavaScript.*

More information and documentation at [http://www.simjs.com](http://www.simjs.com)

SIM.JS is a library for modeling discrete time event systems: 

  * The library provides constructs to create Entity which are the active 
  actors in the system and encapsulate the state and logic of the system 
  operations. 

  * The entities contend for *resources*, which can be Facilities (services 
  that are requested by entities; facilities have a maximum limit on number 
  of concurrent users) and Buffers (resources that can store finite amount 
  of tokens; entities store or retrieve tokens from the buffers). 

  * The entities communicate by waiting on Events or by sending Messages. 

  * Statistics recording and analysis capability is provided by Data Series 
  (collection of discrete, time-independent observations), Time Series 
  (collection of discrete, time-dependent observations) and Population 
  (the behavior of population growth and decline). 

  * SIM.JS also provides a random number generation library to generate seeded 
  random variates from various distributions, including uniform, exponential, 
  normal, gamma, pareto and others.

*SIM.JS is written in _idiomatic_  JavaScript*. The library is written in 
event-based design paradigm: the changes in system states are notified via 
callback functions. The design takes advantage of the powerful feature sets 
of JavaScript: prototype based inheritance, first-class functions, closures, 
anonymous functions, runtime object modifications and so on. Of course, a 
knowledge of these principles is not required (a lot of this behind the scenes), 
but we do certainly hope that using SIM.JS will be pleasurable experience for 
the amateur as well as the experienced practitioners of JavaScript.
