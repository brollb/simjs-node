	* The authors of this library are passionate about Discrete Event Simulations, and hope to see its widespread use in education as well as everyday applications. The authors also believe in this era of Web 2.0, web-based applications are the best way to reach people. Which is why they concluded that there is a need for a Web enabled simulation engine.
	* These days one can `boot linux <bellard.org/jslinux>`_ with JavaScript, play `Doom <developer.mozilla.org/en-US/demos/detail/doom-on-the-web>`_, run myriad of productivity application on the Web, then why not simulations? We say its about time!
